# Files required for the addon to work

## Files for the socket module to work:
- _socket.pyd
- select.pyd

These files should be copied to *CASCADEUR PATH\python\DLLs*

## Commands that are used by the addon
The whole *external* folder should be copied to the commands folder.
By default the commands path is *CASCADEUR PATH\resources\scripts\python\commands*.
But it can be changed by defining a path in *CASCADEUR PATH\resources\settings.ini*.
