# Cascadeur part of the add-on
For the addon to work properly the command files should be copied to the correct location.

1. The entire ***externals*** folder should be copied to the commands folder.
By default the commands path is ***CASCADEUR PATH\resources\scripts\python\commands***. (So the path of the command files should be '***\commands\externals\temp_exporter.py***')
2. Restart Cascadeur
<br>If you did everything correctly there will be a commands > External commands menu with **Temp Exporter** and **Temp Importer** commands in Cascadeur.
